# CovidMapStats
Program which takes data from the University of Maryland's Covid Map API and spits it out into a nice csv file. I am in no way affiliated with them.

Simply open the fields.py file and comment out any fields you don't want. Note that some fields are only present for particular queries.

Run the covid.py and it will spit out a nice csv file for you with all your selected fields.

Includes support for both AU/US format date inputs - which can be toggled within covid.py.
